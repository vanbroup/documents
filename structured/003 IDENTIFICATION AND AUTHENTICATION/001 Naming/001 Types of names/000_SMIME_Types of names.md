### 3.1.1 Types of names

When the `subject:commonName` of a Certificate issued to an Individual does not contain a Mailbox Address, it is specified as a Personal Name or Pseudonym as described in [Section 7.1.4.2.2](#71422-subject-distinguished-name-fields)(a). 

Names consisting of multiple words are permitted. Given names joined with a hyphen are considered as one single given name. Subjects with more than one given name MAY choose one or several of their given names in any sequence. Subjects MAY choose the order of their given name(s) and surname in accordance with national preference.

The CA MAY allow common variations or abbreviations of Personal Names consistent with local practice.
