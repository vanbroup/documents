### 3.2.8 Reliability of verification sources

Before relying on a source of verification data to validate Certificate Requests, the CA SHALL verify its suitability as a Reliable Data Source. Enterprise RA records are a Reliable Data Source for Individual Subject attributes included in Sponsor-validated Certificates issued to the Enterprise RA’s Organisation.

The CA or RA MAY rely upon a letter attesting that Subject Information or other fact is correct. The CA or RA SHALL verify that the letter was written by an accountant, lawyer, government official, or other reliable third party in the Applicant’s jurisdiction customarily relied upon for such information. 

An Attestation SHALL include a copy of documentation supporting the fact to be attested. The CA or RA SHALL use a Reliable Method of Communication to contact the sender and to confirm the Attestation is authentic.
