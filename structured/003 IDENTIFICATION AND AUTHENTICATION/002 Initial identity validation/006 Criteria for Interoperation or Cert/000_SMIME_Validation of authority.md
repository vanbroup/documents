### 3.2.6 Validation of authority

Before commencing to issue `Organization-validated` and `Sponsor-validated` Certificates for an Applicant, the CA or RA SHALL use a Reliable Method of Communication to verify the authority and approval of an Applicant Representative to perform one or more of the following:

*  to act as an Enterprise RA;
*  to request issuance or revocation of Certificates; or 
*  to assign responsibilities to others to act in these roles. 

The CA or RA MAY establish a process that allows an Applicant to specify the individuals who may act as Applicant Representatives on an ongoing basis. The CA SHALL provide an Applicant with a list of its authorized Applicant Representatives upon the Applicant's verified written request.

The CA or RA MAY use the sources listed in [Section 3.2.3.2.1](#3231-attribute-collection-of-organization-identity) to verify the Reliable Method of Communication. Provided that the CA or RA uses a Reliable Method of Communication, the CA or RA MAY establish the authenticity of the Certificate Request directly with the Applicant Representative or with an authoritative source within the Applicant's organization, such as the Applicant's main business offices, corporate offices, human resource offices, information technology offices, or other department that the CA or RA deems appropriate.
