### 3.2.3 Authentication of individual identity

If an Applicant subject to this [Section 3.2.3](#323-authentication-of-individual-identity) is a natural person, then the CA SHALL verify the Applicant's name, Applicant's address, and the authenticity of the certificate request.

The CA SHALL verify the Applicant's name using a legible copy, which discernibly shows the Applicant's face, of at least one currently valid government-issued photo ID (passport, drivers license, military ID, national ID, or equivalent document type). The CA SHALL inspect the copy for any indication of alteration or falsification.

The CA SHALL verify the Applicant's address using a form of identification that the CA determines to be reliable, such as a government ID, utility bill, or bank or credit card statement. The CA MAY rely on the same government-issued ID that was used to verify the Applicant's name.

The CA SHALL verify the certificate request with the Applicant using a Reliable Method of Communication.
