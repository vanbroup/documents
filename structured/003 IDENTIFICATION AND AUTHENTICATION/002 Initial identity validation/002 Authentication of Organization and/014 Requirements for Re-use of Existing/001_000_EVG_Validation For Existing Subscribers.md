1. The Principal Individual verified under [Section 3.2.2.2.2](#32222-acceptable-method-of-verification) (4) if the individual is the same person as verified by the CA in connection with the Applicant's previously issued and currently valid EV Certificate;
2. The Applicant's Place of Business under [Section 3.2.2.4.1](#32241-address-of-applicants-place-of-business);
3. The Applicant's Verified Method of Communication required by [Section 3.2.2.5](#3225-verified-method-of-communication) but still MUST perform the verification required by [Section 3.2.2.5.2](#32252-acceptable-methods-of-verification) (B);
4. The Applicant's Operational Existence under [Section 3.2.2.6](#3226-verification-of-applicants-operational-existence);

6. The Applicant's right to use the specified Domain Name under [Section 3.2.2.7](#3227-verification-of-applicants-domain-name), provided that the CA verifies that the WHOIS record still shows the same registrant as when the CA verified the specified Domain Name for the initial EV Certificate.
