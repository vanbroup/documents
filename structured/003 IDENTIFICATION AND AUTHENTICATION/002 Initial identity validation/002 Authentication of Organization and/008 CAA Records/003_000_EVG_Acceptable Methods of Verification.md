Acceptable methods of verification of the Signing Authority of the Contract Signer, and the EV Authority of the Certificate Approver, as applicable, include:

1. **Verified Professional Letter**: The Signing Authority of the Contract Signer, and/or the EV Authority of the Certificate Approver, MAY be verified by reliance on a Verified Professional Letter;
2. **Corporate Resolution**: The Signing Authority of the Contract Signer, and/or the EV Authority of the Certificate Approver, MAY be verified by reliance on a properly authenticated corporate resolution that confirms that the person has been granted such Signing Authority, provided that such resolution is

   i. certified by the appropriate corporate officer (e.g., secretary), and
   ii. the CA can reliably verify that the certification was validly signed by such person, and that such person does have the requisite authority to provide such certification;

3. **Independent Confirmation from Applicant**: The Signing Authority of the Contract Signer, and/or the EV Authority of the Certificate Approver, MAY be verified by obtaining an Independent Confirmation from the Applicant (as described in [Section 3.2.2.11.4](#322114-independent-confirmation-from-applicant));
4. **Contract between CA and Applicant**: The EV Authority of the Certificate Approver MAY be verified by reliance on a contract between the CA and the Applicant that designates the Certificate Approver with such EV Authority, provided that the contract is signed by the Contract Signer and provided that the agency and Signing Authority of the Contract Signer have been verified;
5. **Prior Equivalent Authority**: The signing authority of the Contract Signer, and/or the EV authority of the Certificate Approver, MAY be verified by relying on a demonstration of Prior Equivalent Authority.

   A.  Prior Equivalent Authority of a Contract Signer MAY be relied upon for confirmation or verification of the signing authority of the Contract Signer when the Contract Signer has executed a binding contract between the CA and the Applicant with a legally valid and enforceable seal or handwritten signature and only when the contract was executed more than 90 days prior to the EV Certificate application.  The CA MUST record sufficient details of the previous agreement to correctly identify it and associate it with the EV application.  Such details MAY include any of the following:

       i. Agreement title,
       ii. Date of Contract Signer's signature,
       iii. Contract reference number, and
       iv. Filing location.

   B.  Prior Equivalent Authority of a Certificate Approver MAY be relied upon for confirmation or verification of the EV Authority of the Certificate Approver when the Certificate Approver has performed one or more of the following:

       i. Under contract to the CA, has served (or is serving) as an Enterprise RA for the Applicant, or
       ii. Has participated in the approval of one or more certificate requests, for certificates issued by the CA and which are currently and verifiably in use by the Applicant.  In this case the CA MUST have contacted the Certificate Approver by phone at a previously validated phone number or have accepted a signed and notarized letter approving the certificate request.

6. **QIIS or QGIS**: The Signing Authority of the Contract Signer, and/or the EV Authority of the Certificate Approver, MAY be verified by a QIIS or QGIS that identifies the Contract Signer and/or the Certificate Approver as a corporate officer, sole proprietor, or other senior official of the Applicant.

7. **Contract Signer's Representation/Warranty**: Provided that the CA verifies that the Contract Signer is an employee or agent of the Applicant, the CA MAY rely on the signing authority of the Contract Signer by obtaining a duly executed representation or warranty from the Contract Signer that includes the following acknowledgments:

   A.  That the Applicant authorizes the Contract Signer to sign the Subscriber Agreement on the Applicant's behalf,
   B.  That the Subscriber Agreement is a legally valid and enforceable agreement,
   C.  That, upon execution of the Subscriber Agreement, the Applicant will be bound by all of its terms and conditions,
   D.  That serious consequences attach to the misuse of an EV certificate, and
   E.  The contract signer has the authority to obtain the digital equivalent of a corporate seal, stamp or officer's signature to establish the authenticity of the company's Web site.
