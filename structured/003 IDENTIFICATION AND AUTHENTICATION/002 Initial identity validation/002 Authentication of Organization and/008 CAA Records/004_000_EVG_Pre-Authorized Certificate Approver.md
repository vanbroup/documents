##### 3.2.2.8.4 Pre-Authorized Certificate Approver

Where the CA and Applicant contemplate the submission of multiple future EV Certificate Requests, then, after the CA:

1. Has verified the name and title of the Contract Signer and that he/she is an employee or agent of the Applicant; and

2. Has verified the Signing Authority of such Contract Signer in accordance with one of the procedures in [Section 3.2.2.8.3](#32283-acceptable-methods-of-verification--authority).

The CA and the Applicant MAY enter into a written agreement, signed by the Contract Signer on behalf of the Applicant, whereby, for a specified term, the Applicant expressly authorizes one or more Certificate Approver(s) designated in such agreement to exercise EV Authority with respect to each future EV Certificate Request submitted on behalf of the Applicant and properly authenticated as originating with, or otherwise being approved by, such Certificate Approver(s).

Such an agreement MUST provide that the Applicant shall be obligated under the Subscriber Agreement for all EV Certificates issued at the request of, or approved by, such Certificate Approver(s) until such EV Authority is revoked, and MUST include mutually agreed-upon provisions for:

   i. authenticating the Certificate Approver when EV Certificate Requests are approved,
   ii. periodic re-confirmation of the EV Authority of the Certificate Approver,
   iii. secure procedures by which the Applicant can notify the CA that the EV Authority of any such Certificate Approver is revoked, and
   iv. such other appropriate precautions as are reasonably necessary.
