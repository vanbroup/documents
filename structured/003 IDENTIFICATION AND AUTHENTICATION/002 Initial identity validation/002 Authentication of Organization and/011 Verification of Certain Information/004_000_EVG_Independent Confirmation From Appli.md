##### 3.2.2.11.4 Independent Confirmation From Applicant

An Independent Confirmation from the Applicant is a confirmation of a particular fact (e.g., confirmation of the employee or agency status of a Contract Signer or Certificate Approver, confirmation of the EV Authority of a Certificate Approver, etc.) that is:

A.  Received by the CA from a Confirming Person (someone other than the person who is the subject of the inquiry) that has the appropriate authority to confirm such a fact, and who represents that he/she has confirmed such fact;
B.  Received by the CA in a manner that authenticates and verifies the source of the confirmation; and
C.  Binding on the Applicant.

An Independent Confirmation from the Applicant MAY be obtained via the following procedure:

1. **Confirmation Request**: The CA MUST initiate a Confirmation Request via an appropriate out-of-band communication, requesting verification or confirmation of the particular fact at issue as follows:

   A.  **Addressee**: The Confirmation Request MUST be directed to:

       i. A position within the Applicant's organization that qualifies as a Confirming Person (e.g., Secretary, President, CEO, CFO, COO, CIO, CSO, Director, etc.) and is identified by name and title in a current QGIS, QIIS, QTIS, Verified Legal Opinion, Verified Accountant Letter, or by contacting the Applicant using a Verified Method of Communication; or
       ii. The Applicant's Registered Agent or Registered Office in the Jurisdiction of Incorporation as listed in the official records of the Incorporating Agency, with instructions that it be forwarded to an appropriate Confirming Person; or
       iii. A named individual verified to be in the direct line of management above the Contract Signer or Certificate Approver by contacting the Applicant's Human Resources Department by phone or mail (at the phone number or address for the Applicant's Place of Business, verified in accordance with these Guidelines).

   B.  **Means of Communication**: The Confirmation Request MUST be directed to the Confirming Person in a manner reasonably likely to reach such person.  The following options are acceptable:

       i. By paper mail addressed to the Confirming Person at:

          1. The address of the Applicant's Place of Business as verified by the CA in accordance with these Guidelines, or
          2. The business address for such Confirming Person specified in a current QGIS, QTIS, QIIS, Verified Professional Letter, or
          3. The address of the Applicant's Registered Agent or Registered Office listed in the official records of the Jurisdiction of Incorporation, or

       ii. By e-mail addressed to the Confirming Person at the business e-mail address for such person listed in a current QGIS, QTIS, QIIS, Verified Legal Opinion, or Verified Accountant Letter; or
       iii. By telephone call to the Confirming Person, where such person is contacted by calling the main phone number of the Applicant's Place of Business (verified in accordance with these Guidelines) and asking to speak to such person, and a person taking the call identifies him- or herself as such person; or
       iv. By facsimile to the Confirming Person at the Place of Business.  The facsimile number must be listed in a current QGIS, QTIS, QIIS, Verified Legal Opinion, or Verified Accountant Letter.  The cover page must be clearly addressed to the Confirming Person.

2. **Confirmation Response**: The CA MUST receive a response to the Confirmation Request from a Confirming Person that confirms the particular fact at issue.  Such response MAY be provided to the CA by telephone, by e-mail, or by paper mail, so long as the CA can reliably verify that it was provided by a Confirming Person in response to the Confirmation Request.

3. The CA MAY rely on a verified Confirming Person to confirm their own contact information: email address, telephone number, and facsimile number.  The CA MAY rely on this verified contact information for future correspondence with the Confirming Person if:

   A.  The domain of the e-mail address is owned by the Applicant and is the Confirming Person's own e-mail address and not a group e-mail alias;
   B.  The Confirming Person's telephone/fax number is verified by the CA to be a telephone number that is part of the organization's telephone system, and is not the personal phone number for the person.
