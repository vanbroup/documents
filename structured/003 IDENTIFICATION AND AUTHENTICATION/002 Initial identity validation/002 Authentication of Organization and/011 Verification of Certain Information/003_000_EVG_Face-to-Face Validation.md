##### 3.2.2.11.3 Face-to-Face Validation

1. **Verification Requirements**: Before relying on face-to-face vetting documents submitted to the CA, the CA MUST verify that the Third-Party Validator meets the following requirements:

   A.  **Qualification of Third-Party Validator**: The CA MUST independently verify that the Third-Party Validator is a legally-qualified Latin Notary or Notary (or legal equivalent in the Applicant's jurisdiction), Lawyer, or Accountant in the jurisdiction of the individual's residency;
   B.  **Document Chain of Custody**: The CA MUST verify that the Third-Party Validator viewed the Vetting Documents in a face-to-face meeting with the individual being validated;
   C.  **Verification of Attestation**: If the Third-Party Validator is not a Latin Notary, then the CA MUST confirm the authenticity of the attestation and vetting documents.

2. **Acceptable Methods of Verification**: Acceptable methods of establishing the foregoing requirements for vetting documents are:

   A.  **Qualification of Third-Party Validator**: The CA MUST verify the professional status of the Third-Party Validator by directly contacting the authority responsible for registering or licensing such Third-Party Validators in the applicable jurisdiction;
   B.  **Document Chain of Custody**: The Third-Party Validator MUST submit a statement to the CA which attests that they obtained the Vetting Documents submitted to the CA for the individual during a face-to-face meeting with the individual;
   C.  **Verification of Attestation**: If the Third-Party Validator is not a Latin Notary, then the CA MUST confirm the authenticity of the vetting documents received from the Third-Party Validator.  The CA MUST make a telephone call to the Third-Party Validator and obtain confirmation from them or their assistant that they performed the face-to-face validation.  The CA MAY rely upon self-reported information obtained from the Third-Party Validator for the sole purpose of performing this verification process.  In circumstances where the attestation is digitally signed, in a manner that confirms the authenticity of the documents, and the identity of the signer as verified by the CA in [Section 3.2.2.11.3](#322113-face-to-face-validation) (1)(A), no further verification of authenticity is required.
