##### 3.2.2.11.2 Verified Accountant Letter

1. **Verification Requirements**: Before relying on an accountant letter submitted to the CA, the CA MUST verify that such accountant letter meets the following requirements:

   A.  **Status of Author**: The CA MUST verify that the accountant letter is authored by an Accounting Practitioner retained or employed by the Applicant and licensed within the country of the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation, Jurisdiction of Registration, or country where the Applicant maintains an office or physical facility.  Verification of license MUST be  through the member organization or regulatory organization in the Accounting Practitioner's country or jurisdiction that is appropriate to contact when verifying an accountant's license to practice in that country or jurisdiction.  Such country or jurisdiction must have an accounting standards body that maintains full membership status with the International Federation of Accountants.
   B.  **Basis of Opinion**: The CA MUST verify that the Accounting Practitioner is acting on behalf of the Applicant and that the conclusions of the Verified Accountant Letter are based on the Accounting Practitioner's stated familiarity with the relevant facts and the exercise of the Accounting Practitioner's professional judgment and expertise;
   C.  **Authenticity**: The CA MUST confirm the authenticity of the Verified Accountant Letter.

2. **Acceptable Methods of Verification**: Acceptable methods of establishing the foregoing requirements for a Verified Accountant Letter are listed here.

   A.  **Status of Author**: The CA MUST verify the professional status of the author of the accountant letter by directly contacting the authority responsible for registering or licensing such Accounting Practitioners in the applicable jurisdiction.
   B.  **Basis of Opinion**: The text of the Verified Accountant Letter MUST make clear that the Accounting Practitioner is acting on behalf of the Applicant and that the information in the letter is based on the Accounting Practitioner's stated familiarity with the relevant facts and the exercise of the practitioner's professional judgment and expertise.  The Verified Accountant Letter MAY also include disclaimers and other limitations customary in the Accounting Practitioner's jurisdiction, provided that the scope of the disclaimed responsibility is not so great as to eliminate any substantial risk (financial, professional, and/or reputational) to the Accounting Practitioner, should the Verified Accountant Letter prove to be erroneous.  Acceptable forms of Verified Accountant Letter are attached as [Appendix C](#appendix-c---sample-accountant-letters-confirming-specified-information).
   C.  **Authenticity**: To confirm the authenticity of the accountant's opinion, the CA MUST make a telephone call or send a copy of the Verified Accountant Letter back to the Accounting Practitioner at the address, phone number, facsimile, or (if available) e-mail address for the Accounting Practitioner listed with the authority responsible for registering or licensing such Accounting Practitioners and obtain confirmation from the Accounting Practitioner or the Accounting Practitioner's assistant that the accountant letter is authentic.  If a phone number is not available from the licensing authority, the CA MAY use the number listed for the Accountant in records provided by the applicable phone company, QGIS, or QIIS.

      In circumstances where the opinion is digitally signed, in a manner that confirms the authenticity of the document and the identity of the signer, as verified by the CA in [Section 3.2.2.11.2](#322112-verified-accountant-letter) (2)(A), no further verification of authenticity is required.
