##### 3.2.2.11.5 Qualified Independent Information Source

A Qualified Independent Information Source (QIIS) is a regularly-updated and publicly available database that is generally recognized as a dependable source for certain information.  A database qualifies as a QIIS if the CA determines that:

1. Industries other than the certificate industry rely on the database for accurate location, contact, or other information; and

2. The database provider updates its data on at least an annual basis.

The CA SHALL use a documented process to check the accuracy of the database and ensure its data is acceptable, including reviewing the database provider's terms of use. The CA SHALL NOT use any data in a QIIS that the CA knows is

  i. self-reported and
  ii. not verified by the QIIS as accurate.

Databases in which the CA or its owners or affiliated companies maintain a controlling interest, or in which any Registration Authorities or subcontractors to whom the CA has outsourced any portion of the vetting process (or their owners or affiliated companies) maintain any ownership or beneficial interest, do not qualify as a QIIS.
