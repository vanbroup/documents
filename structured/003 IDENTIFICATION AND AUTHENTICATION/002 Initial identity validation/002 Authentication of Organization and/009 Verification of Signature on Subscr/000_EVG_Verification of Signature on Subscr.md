#### 3.2.2.9 Verification of Signature on Subscriber Agreement and EV Certificate Requests

Both the Subscriber Agreement and each non-pre-authorized EV Certificate Request MUST be signed.  The Subscriber Agreement MUST be signed by an authorized Contract Signer.  The EV Certificate Request MUST be signed by the Certificate Requester submitting the document, unless the Certificate Request has been pre-authorized in line with [Section 3.2.2.8.4](#32284-pre-authorized-certificate-approver).  If the Certificate Requester is not also an authorized Certificate Approver, then an authorized Certificate Approver MUST independently approve the EV Certificate Request.  In all cases, applicable signatures MUST be a legally valid and contain an enforceable seal or handwritten signature (for a paper Subscriber Agreement and/or EV Certificate Request), or a legally valid and enforceable electronic signature (for an electronic Subscriber Agreement and/or EV Certificate Request), that binds the Applicant to the terms of each respective document.
