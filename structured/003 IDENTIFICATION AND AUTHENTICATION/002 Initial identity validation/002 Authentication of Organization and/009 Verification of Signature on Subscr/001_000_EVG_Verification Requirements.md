##### 3.2.2.9.1 Verification Requirements

1. **Signature**: The CA MUST authenticate the signature of the Contract Signer on the Subscriber Agreement and the signature of the Certificate Requester on each EV Certificate Request in a manner that makes it reasonably certain that the person named as the signer in the applicable document is, in fact, the person who signed the document on behalf of the Applicant.

2. **Approval Alternative**: In cases where an EV Certificate Request is signed and submitted by a Certificate Requester who does not also function as a Certificate Approver, approval and adoption of the EV Certificate Request by a Certificate Approver in accordance with the requirements of [Section 3.2.2.10](#32210-verification-of-approval-of-ev-certificate-request) can substitute for authentication of the signature of the Certificate Requester on such EV Certificate Request.
