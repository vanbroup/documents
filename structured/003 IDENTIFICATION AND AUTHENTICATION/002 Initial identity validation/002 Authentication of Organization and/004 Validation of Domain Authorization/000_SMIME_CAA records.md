#### 3.2.2.4 CAA records

This version of the S/MIME Baseline Requirements does not require the CA to check for CAA records. The CAA property tags for `issue`, `issuewild`, and `iodef` as specified in [RFC 8659](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8659) are not recognized for the issuance of S/MIME Certificates.
