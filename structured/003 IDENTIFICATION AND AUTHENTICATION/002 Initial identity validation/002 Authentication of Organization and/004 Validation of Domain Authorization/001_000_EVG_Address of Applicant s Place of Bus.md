##### 3.2.2.4.1 Address of Applicant's Place of Business

1. **Verification Requirements**: To verify the Applicant's physical existence and business presence, the CA MUST verify that the physical address provided by the Applicant is an address where the Applicant or a Parent/Subsidiary Company conducts business operations (not, for example, a mail drop or P.O. box, or 'care of' (C/O) address, such as an address for an agent of the Organization), and is the address of the Applicant's Place of Business.

2. **Acceptable Methods of Verification**

   A.  **Place of Business in the Country of Incorporation or Registration**

       i. For Applicants whose Place of Business is in the same country as the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration and whose Place of Business is NOT the same as that indicated in the relevant Qualified Government Information Source used in [Section 3.2.2.2](#3222-verification-of-applicants-legal-existence-and-identity) to verify legal existence:

          1. For Applicants listed at the same Place of Business address in the current version of either at least one QGIS (other than that used to verify legal existence), QIIS or QTIS, the CA MUST confirm that the Applicant's address, as listed in the EV Certificate Request, is a valid business address for the Applicant or a Parent/Subsidiary Company by reference to such QGIS, QIIS, or QTIS, and MAY rely on the Applicant's representation that such address is its Place of Business;

          2. For Applicants who are not listed at the same Place of Business address in the current version of either at least one QIIS or QTIS, the CA MUST confirm that the address provided by the Applicant in the EV Certificate Request is the Applicant's or a Parent/Subsidiary Company's business address, by obtaining documentation of a site visit to the business address, which MUST be performed by a reliable individual or firm.  The documentation of the site visit MUST:

             a. Verify that the Applicant's business is located at the exact address stated in the EV Certificate Request (e.g., via permanent signage, employee confirmation, etc.),
             b. Identify the type of facility (e.g., office in a commercial building, private residence, storefront, etc.) and whether it appears to be a permanent business location,
             c. Indicate whether there is a permanent sign (that cannot be moved) that identifies the Applicant,
             d. Indicate whether there is evidence that the Applicant is conducting ongoing business activities at the site (not that it is just, for example, a mail drop, P.O. box, etc.), and
             e. Include one or more photos of
                i. the exterior of the site (showing signage indicating the Applicant's name, if present, and showing the street address if possible), and
                ii. the interior reception area or workspace.

       ii. For all Applicants, the CA MAY alternatively rely on a Verified Professional Letter that indicates the address of the Applicant's or a Parent/Subsidiary Company's Place of Business and that business operations are conducted there.
       iii. For Government Entity Applicants, the CA MAY rely on the address contained in the records of the QGIS in the Applicant's jurisdiction.
       iv. For Applicants whose Place of Business is in the same country as the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration and where the QGIS used in [Section 3.2.2.2](#3222-verification-of-applicants-legal-existence-and-identity) to verify legal existence contains a business address for the Applicant, the CA MAY rely on the address in the QGIS to confirm the Applicant's or a Parent/Subsidiary Company's address as listed in the EV Certificate Request, and MAY rely on the Applicant's representation that such address is its Place of Business.

   B.  **Place of Business not in the Country of Incorporation or Registration**: The CA MUST rely on a Verified Professional Letter that indicates the address of the Applicant's Place of Business and that business operations are conducted there.
