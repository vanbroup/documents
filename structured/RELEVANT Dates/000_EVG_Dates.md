**Implementers' Note**: Version 1.3 of these EV Guidelines was published on 20 November 2010 and supplemented through May 2012 when version 1.4 was published.  ETSI TS 102 042 and ETSI TR 101 564 Technical Report: Guidance on ETSI TS 102 042 for Issuing Extended Validation Certificates for Auditors and CSPs reference version 1.3 of these EV Guidelines, and ETSI Draft EN 319 411-1 references version 1.4.  Version 1.4.5 of Webtrust(r) for Certification Authorities â€“ Extended Validation Audit Criteria references version 1.4.5 of these EV Guidelines.  As illustrated in the Document History table above, the CA/Browser Forum continues to improve relevant industry guidelines, including this document, the Baseline Requirements, and the Network and Certificate System Security Requirements.  We encourage all CAs to conform to each revision on the date specified without awaiting a corresponding update to an applicable audit criterion.  In the event of a conflict between an existing audit criterion and a guideline revision, we will communicate with the audit community and attempt to resolve any uncertainty. We will respond to implementation questions directed to questions@cabforum.org.  Our coordination with compliance auditors will continue as we develop guideline revision cycles that harmonize with the revision cycles for audit criteria, the compliance auditing periods and cycles of CAs, and the CA/Browser Forum's guideline implementation dates.
