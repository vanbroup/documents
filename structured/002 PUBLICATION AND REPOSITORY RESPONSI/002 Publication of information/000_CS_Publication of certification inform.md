## 2.2 Publication of certification information

The CA and its Root CA MUST develop, implement, enforce, display prominently on its web site, and periodically update its policies and practices, including its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, that implement the most current version of these Requirements. The Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement MUST specify the CA's (and applicable Root CA's) entire root certificate hierarchy including all roots that its Code Signing Certificates depend on for proof of those Code Signing Certificates' authenticity.

Each CA MUST represent that it has disclosed all Cross Certificates in its Certificate Policy/Certificate Practice Statement that identify the CA as the Subject, provided that the CA arranged for or accepted the establishment of the trust relationship (i.e. the Cross Certificate at issue).

Each CA, including Root CAs, MUST publicly disclose their policies and practices through an appropriate and readily accessible online means that is available on a 24x7 basis. The CA MUST publicly disclose its Certificate Practice Statement and/or Certificate Policies and structure the disclosures in accordance with RFC 3647.

Each CA MUST give public effect to these Requirements and represent that they will adhere to the latest published version by either (i) incorporating the Requirements directly into their respective Certification Practice Statements or (ii) by referencing the Requirements using a clause such as the following:

> \[Name of CA\] conforms to the current version of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Code Signing Certificates published at \[URL\]. If there is any inconsistency between this document and those Requirements, those Requirements take precedence over this document.

In either case, each CA MUST include a link to the official version of these Requirements. In addition, each CA MUST include (directly or by reference) applicable parts of these Requirements in all contracts with Subordinate CAs, RAs, Signing Services and subcontractors, that involve or relate to the issuance or management of Certificates. CAs MUST enforce compliance with such terms.
