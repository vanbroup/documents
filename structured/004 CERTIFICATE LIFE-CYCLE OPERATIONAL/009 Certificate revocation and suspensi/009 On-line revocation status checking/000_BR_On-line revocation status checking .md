### 4.9.9 On-line revocation/status checking availability

OCSP responses MUST conform to RFC6960 and/or RFC5019. OCSP responses MUST either:

1. Be signed by the CA that issued the Certificates whose revocation status is being checked, or
2. Be signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose
revocation status is being checked.

In the latter case, the OCSP signing Certificate MUST contain an extension of type `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck`, as
defined by RFC6960.
