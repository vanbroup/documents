### 4.9.11 Other forms of revocation advertisements available

Because some Application Software Suppliers utilize non-standard revocation mechanisms, CAs MUST, if requested by the Application Software Supplier and using a method of communication specified by the Application Software Vendor, notify the Application Software Supplier whenever the CA revokes a Code Signing Certificate because (i) the CA mis-issued the Certificate, (ii) the Certificate was used to sign Suspect Code, or (iii) there is a suspected or actual compromise of the Applicant's or CA's Private Key.
