### 4.1.2 Enrollment process and responsibilities

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA SHALL obtain the following documentation from the Applicant:

1. A Certificate Request; and
2. An executed Subscriber Agreement and/or Terms of Use.

The Certificate Request and Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use SHALL be in a form prescribed by the CA and SHALL comply with these Requirements including [Section 9.6.3](#963-subscriber-representations-and-warranties). The CA SHOULD obtain any additional documentation the CA determines necessary to fulfill these Requirements.

The Certificate Request SHALL contain a request from, or on behalf of, the Applicant for the issuance of a Certificate, and a certification by, or on behalf of, the Applicant that all of the information contained therein is correct.

One Certificate Request MAY suffice for multiple Certificates to be issued to the same Applicant, subject to the validation reuse periods described in [Section 4.2.1](#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions), provided that each Certificate is supported by a valid, current Certificate Request signed by the appropriate Applicant Representative on behalf of the Applicant. 

A CA may rely on a previously verified Certificate Request to issue a replacement Certificate if:

1. The previous Certificate being referenced was not revoked;
2. The expiration date of the replacement Certificate is the same as the previous Certificate being referenced; and
3. The Subject Information of the Certificate is the same as the previous Certificate being referenced.
