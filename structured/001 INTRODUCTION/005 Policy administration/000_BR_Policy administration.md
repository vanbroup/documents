## 1.5 Policy administration

The Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates present criteria established by the CA/Browser Forum for use by Certification Authorities when issuing, maintaining, and revoking publicly-trusted Certificates. This document may be revised from time to time, as appropriate, in accordance with procedures adopted by the CA/Browser Forum. Because one of the primary beneficiaries of this document is the end user, the Forum openly invites anyone to make recommendations and suggestions by email to the CA/Browser Forum at <questions@cabforum.org>. The Forum members value all input, regardless of source, and will seriously consider all such input.
