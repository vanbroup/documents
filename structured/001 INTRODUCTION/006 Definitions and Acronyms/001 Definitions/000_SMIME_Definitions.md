For Certificates issued to devices, the Applicant is the entity that controls or operates the device named in the Certificate, even if the device is sending the actual Certificate Request.

**Applicant Representative**: A Natural Person or human sponsor who is either the Applicant, employed by the Applicant, or an authorized agent who has express authority to represent the Applicant:

  1. who signs and submits, or approves a Certificate Request on behalf of the Applicant; 
  2. who signs and submits a Subscriber Agreement on behalf of the Applicant; and/or
  3. who acknowledges the Terms of Use on behalf of the Applicant when the Applicant is an Affiliate of the CA or is the CA.
