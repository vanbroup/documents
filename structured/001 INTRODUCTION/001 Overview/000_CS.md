## 1.1 Overview

The Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted CodeSigning Certificates describe a subset of the requirements that a Certification Authority must meet to issue Code Signing Certificates. 

The scope of these Requirements includes all "Code Signing Certificates", as defined below, and associated Timestamp Authorities, and all Certification Authorities technically capable of issuing Code Signing Certificates, including any Root CA that is publicly trusted for code signing and all other CAs that might serve to complete the validation path to such Root CA. These Requirements do not address the issuance, use, maintenance, or revocation of Certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, where the Root CA Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier (as defined in the Baseline Requirements).

The primary goal of these Requirements is to enable trusted signing of code intended for public distribution, while addressing user concerns about the trustworthiness of signed objects and accurately identifying the software publisher. The Requirements also serve to inform users about the purpose of signed code, help users make informed decisions when relying on Certificates, help establish the legitimacy of signed code, help maintain the trustworthiness of software Platforms, help users make informed software choices, and limit the spread of malware. Code Signing Certificates do not identify a particular software object, identifying only the publisher of software.
