### 1.4.2 Prohibited certificate uses
EV Certificates focus only on the identity of the Subject named in the Certificate, and not on the behavior of the Subject.  As such, an EV Certificate is **not** intended to provide any assurances, or otherwise represent or warrant:

1. That the Subject named in the EV Certificate is actively engaged in doing business;
2. That the Subject named in the EV Certificate complies with applicable laws;
3. That the Subject named in the EV Certificate is trustworthy, honest, or reputable in its business dealings; or
4. That it is "safe" to do business with the Subject named in the EV Certificate.
