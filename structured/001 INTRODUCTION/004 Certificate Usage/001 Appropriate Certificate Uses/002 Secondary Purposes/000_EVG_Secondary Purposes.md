#### 1.4.1.2 Secondary Purposes

The secondary purposes of an EV Certificate are to help establish the legitimacy of a business claiming to operate a Web site or distribute executable code, and to provide a vehicle that can be used to assist in addressing problems related to phishing, malware, and other forms of online identity fraud.  By providing more reliable third-party verified identity and address information regarding the business, EV Certificates may help to:

1. Make it more difficult to mount phishing and other online identity fraud attacks using Certificates;
2. Assist companies that may be the target of phishing attacks or online identity fraud by providing them with a tool to better identify themselves to users; and
3. Assist law enforcement organizations in their investigations of phishing and other online identity fraud, including where appropriate, contacting, investigating, or taking legal action against the Subject.
