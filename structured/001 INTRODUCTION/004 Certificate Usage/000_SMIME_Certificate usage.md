## 1.4 Certificate usage

The primary goal of these Requirements is to provide a framework of “reasonable assurance” to senders and recipients of email messages that the Subject identified in an S/MIME Certificate has control of the domain or Mailbox Address being asserted. A variation of this use case is where an Individual or organization digitally signs email to establish its authenticity and source of origin.
