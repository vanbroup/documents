#### 1.3.2.1 Enterprise Registration authorities
The CA MAY contractually authorize a Subscriber to perform the RA function and authorize the CA to issue additional EV Certificates.  In such case, the Subscriber SHALL be considered an Enterprise RA, and the following requirements SHALL apply:

1. In all cases, the Subscriber MUST be an organization verified by the CA in accordance with these Guidelines;
2. The CA MUST impose these limitations as a contractual requirement with the Enterprise RA and monitor compliance by the Enterprise RA; and
3. The Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence requirements of [Section 3.2.2.13](#32213-final-cross-correlation-and-due-diligence) MAY be performed by a single person representing the Enterprise RA.

Enterprise RAs that authorize the issuance of EV Certificates solely for its own organization are exempted from the audit requirements of [Section 8](#8-compliance-audit-and-other-assessments). In all other cases, the requirements of [Section 8](#8-compliance-audit-and-other-assessments) SHALL apply.
