The following Registration Schemes are currently recognized as valid under these

  used in the Registration Scheme identifier shall match that of the
  subject’s jurisdiction as specified in
  [Section 7.1.4.2.4](#71424-subject-jurisdiction-of-incorporation-or-registration-field).

  and/or [Section 7.1.2.2](#7122-cabrowser-forum-organization-identifier-extension).

  authority against the organization as identified by the Subject Organization
  Name Field (see [Section 7.1.4.2.1](#71421-subject-organization-name-field)) and
  Subject Registration Number Field (see

  matching a globally unique registration number) against the organization as
  identified by the Subject Organization Name Field (see
