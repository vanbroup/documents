# Appendix E - Sample Contract Signer's Representation/Warranty (Informative)

A CA may rely on the Contract Signer's authority to enter into the Subscriber Agreement using a representation/warranty executed by the Contract Signer.  An example of an acceptable warranty is as follows:

[CA] and Applicant are entering into a legally valid and enforceable Subscriber Agreement that creates extensive obligations on Applicant.  An EV Certificate serves as a form of digital identity for Applicant.  The loss or misuse of this identity can result in great harm to the Applicant.  By signing this Subscriber Agreement, the contract signer acknowledges that they have the authority to obtain the digital equivalent of a company stamp, seal, or (where applicable) officer's signature to establish the authenticity of the company's website, and that [Applicant name] is responsible for all uses of its EV Certificate.  By signing this Agreement on behalf of [Applicant name], the contract signer represents that the contract signer

   i. is acting as an authorized representative of [Applicant name],
   ii. is expressly authorized by [Applicant name] to sign Subscriber Agreements and approve EV Certificate requests on Applicant's behalf, and
   iii. has confirmed Applicant's right to use the domain(s) to be included in EV Certificates.
