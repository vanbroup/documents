# Appendix B - Transition of Extant S/MIME CAs

Following the Effective Date for v 1.0.0 of these Requirements (September 1, 2023) an Extant S/MIME CA MAY continue to issue end entity S/MIME Certificates that are compliant with these Requirements. 

On or after September 15, 2024, all newly-issued Publicly-Trusted end entity S/MIME Certificates SHALL be issued from S/MIME Subordinate CAs that are compliant with these Requirements.

For backwards compatibility, Extant S/MIME CA Certificates that share the same Public Keys with S/MIME Subordinate CAs that are compliant with these Requirements, or are no longer used for signing end entity S/MIME Certificates, are not required to be revoked.
