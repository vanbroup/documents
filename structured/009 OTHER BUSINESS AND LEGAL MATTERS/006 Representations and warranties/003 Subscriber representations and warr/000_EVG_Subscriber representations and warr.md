### 9.6.3 Subscriber representations and warranties
Section 9.6.3 of the Baseline Requirements applies equally to EV Certificates.  In cases where the Certificate Request does not contain all necessary information about the Applicant, the CA MUST additionally confirm the data with the Certificate Approver or Contract Signer rather than the Certificate Requester.

EV Certificate Applicants make the commitments and warranties set forth in Section 9.6.3 of the Baseline Requirements for the benefit of the CA and Certificate Beneficiaries.
