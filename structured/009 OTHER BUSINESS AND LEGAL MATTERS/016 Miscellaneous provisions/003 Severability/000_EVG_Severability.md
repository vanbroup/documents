### 9.16.3 Severability
The CA MAY issue EV Certificates, provided that the CA and its Root CA satisfy the requirements in these Guidelines and the Baseline Requirements.

If a court or government body with jurisdiction over the activities covered by these Guidelines determines that the performance of any mandatory requirement is illegal, then such requirement is considered reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal.  This applies only to operations or certificate issuances that are subject to the laws of that jurisdiction.  The parties involved SHALL notify the CA/Browser Forum of the facts, circumstances, and law(s) involved, so that the CA/Browser Forum may revise these Guidelines accordingly.
