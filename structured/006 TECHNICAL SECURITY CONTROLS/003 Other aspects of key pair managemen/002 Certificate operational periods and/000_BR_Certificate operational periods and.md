### 6.3.2 Certificate operational periods and key pair usage periods

Subscriber Certificates issued on or after 1 September 2020 SHOULD NOT have a Validity Period greater than 397 days and MUST NOT have a Validity Period greater than 398 days.
Subscriber Certificates issued after 1 March 2018, but prior to 1 September 2020, MUST NOT have a Validity Period greater than 825 days.
Subscriber Certificates issued after 1 July 2016 but prior to 1 March 2018 MUST NOT have a Validity Period greater than 39 months.

For the purpose of calculations, a day is measured as 86,400 seconds. Any amount of time greater than this, including fractional seconds and/or leap seconds, shall represent an additional day. For this reason, Subscriber Certificates SHOULD NOT be issued for the maximum permissible time by default, in order to account for such adjustments.
