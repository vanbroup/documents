### 6.1.1 Key pair generation
All requirements in Section 6.1.1.1 of the Baseline Requirements apply equally to EV Certificates. However, for Root CA Key Pairs generated after the release of these Guidelines, the Root CA Key Pair generation ceremony MUST be witnessed by the CA's Qualified Auditor in order to observe the process and the controls over the integrity and confidentiality of the Root CA Key Pairs produced.  The Qualified Auditor MUST then issue a report opining that the CA, during its Root CA Key Pair and Certificate generation process:

  1. Documented its Root CA key generation and protection procedures in its Certificate Policy, and its Certification Practices Statement;
  2. Included appropriate detail in its Root Key Generation Script;
  3. Maintained effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that the Root CA key pair was generated and protected in conformity with the procedures described in its CP/CPS and with its Root Key Generation Script;
  4. Performed, during the Root CA key generation process, all the procedures required by its Root Key Generation Script.
