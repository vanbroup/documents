### 5.4.3 Retention period for audit log

The CA and each Delegated Third Party SHALL retain, for at least two (2) years:

  1. CA certificate and key lifecycle management event records (as set forth in [Section 5.4.1](#541-types-of-events-recorded) (1)) after the later occurrence of:
     1. the destruction of the CA Private Key; or
     2. the revocation or expiration of the final CA Certificate in that set of Certificates that have an X.509v3 `basicConstraints` extension with the `cA` field set to true and which share a common Public Key corresponding to the CA Private Key;
  2. Subscriber Certificate lifecycle management event records (as set forth in [Section 5.4.1](#541-types-of-events-recorded) (2)) after the expiration of the Subscriber Certificate;
  3. Any security event records (as set forth in [Section 5.4.1](#541-types-of-events-recorded) (3)) after the event occurred.

Note: While these Requirements set the minimum retention period, the CA MAY choose a greater value as more appropriate in order to be able to investigate possible security or other types of incidents that will require retrospection and examination of past audit log events.
