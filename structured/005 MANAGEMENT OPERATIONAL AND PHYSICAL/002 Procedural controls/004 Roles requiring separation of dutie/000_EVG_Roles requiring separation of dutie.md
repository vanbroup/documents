### 5.2.4 Roles requiring separation of duties
1. The CA MUST enforce rigorous control procedures for the separation of validation duties to ensure that no one person can single-handedly validate and authorize the issuance of an EV Certificate.  The Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence steps, as outlined in [Section 3.2.2.13](#32213-final-cross-correlation-and-due-diligence), MAY be performed by one of the persons.  For example, one Validation Specialist MAY review and verify all the Applicant information and a second Validation Specialist MAY approve issuance of the EV Certificate.
2. Such controls MUST be auditable.
