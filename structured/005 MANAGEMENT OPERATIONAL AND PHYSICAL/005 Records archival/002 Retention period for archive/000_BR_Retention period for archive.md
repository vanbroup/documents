### 5.5.2 Retention period for archive

Archived audit logs (as set forth in [Section 5.5.1](#551-types-of-records-archived) SHALL be retained for a period of at least two (2) years from their record creation timestamp, or as long as they are required to be retained per [Section 5.4.3](#543-retention-period-for-audit-log), whichever is longer.

Additionally, the CA and each Delegated Third Party SHALL retain, for at least two (2) years:
1. All archived documentation related to the security of Certificate Systems, Certificate Management Systems, Root CA Systems and Delegated Third Party Systems (as set forth in [Section 5.5.1](#551-types-of-records-archived)); and
2. All archived documentation relating to the verification, issuance, and revocation of certificate requests and Certificates (as set forth in [Section 5.5.1](#551-types-of-records-archived)) after the later occurrence of:
   1. such records and documentation were last relied upon in the verification, issuance, or revocation of certificate requests and Certificates; or
   2. the expiration of the Subscriber Certificates relying upon such records and documentation.

Note: While these Requirements set the minimum retention period, the CA MAY choose a greater value as more appropriate in order to be able to investigate possible security or other types of incidents that will require retrospection and examination of past records archived.
