# 8. COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS

The CA SHALL at all times:

1. Issue Certificates and operate its PKI in accordance with all law applicable to its business and the Certificates it issues in every jurisdiction in which it operates;
2. Comply with these Requirements;
3. Comply with the audit requirements set forth in this section; and
4. Be licensed as a CA in each jurisdiction where it operates, if licensing is required by the law of such jurisdiction for the issuance of Certificates.

**Note**: The CA/Browser Forum continues to improve the S/MIME Baseline Requirements while CPA Canada/WebTrust and ETSI also continue to update their audit criteria. We encourage all CAs to conform to each revision herein on the date specified without awaiting a corresponding update to an applicable audit criterion. In the event of a conflict between an existing audit criterion and a revision to the S/MIME Baseline Requirements, we will communicate with the audit community and attempt to resolve any uncertainty, and we will respond to implementation questions directed to <questions@cabforum.org>.
