The CA MUST undergo a conformity assessment audit for compliance with these Requirements performed in accordance with one of the following schemes:

1.  For Audit Periods starting before November 1st, 2020: "WebTrust for CAs v2.0 or newer" AND "WebTrust for Certification Authorities -- Publicly Trusted Code Signing Certificates v1.0.1 or newer"; or
2.  For Audit Periods starting before November 1st, 2020: "WebTrust for CAs v2.0 or newer" AND "WebTrust for Certification Authorities -- Extended Validation Code Signing v1.4.1 or newer"; or
3.  “WebTrust for CAs v2.0 or newer” AND “WebTrust for Certification Authorities – Code Signing Baseline Requirements v2.0 or newer”; or 
4.  ETSI EN 319 411-1, which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401 (the latest version of the referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or
5.  If a government CA is required by its Certificate Policy to use a different internal audit scheme, it MAY use such scheme provided that the audit either (a) encompasses all requirements of one of the above schemes or (b) consists of comparable criteria that are available for public review.

Whichever scheme is chosen, it MUST incorporate periodic monitoring and/or accountability procedures to ensure that its audits continue to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.

The audit MUST be conducted by a Qualified Auditor, as specified in [Section 8.2](#82-identityqualifications-of-assessor).

The audit MUST cover all CA obligations under these Guidelines regardless of whether they are performed directly by the CA, an RA, or subcontractor.
