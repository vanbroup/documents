## 8.4 Topics covered by assessment

The CA SHALL undergo an audit in accordance with one of the following schemes:

1. For Audit Periods starting before the Effective Date defined in [Section 1.2.1](#121-revisions) of the first version of these Requirements, “WebTrust for CAs v2.2.2 or newer”; or
2. For Audit Periods starting after the Effective Date defined in [Section 1.2.1](#121-revisions) of the first version of these Requirements, “WebTrust for CAs v2.2.2 or newer” AND “WebTrust for S/MIME Baseline Requirements v1.0.0 or newer”; or
3. ETSI TS 119 411-6 v1.1.1 or newer, which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401, ETSI EN 319 411-1 and ETSI EN 319 411-2 (the latest version of the referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or
4. If a Government CA is required by its Certificate Policy to use a different internal audit scheme, it MAY use such scheme provided that the audit either
   a. encompasses all requirements of one of the above schemes; or
   b. consists of comparable criteria that are available for public review.
Whichever scheme is chosen, it SHALL incorporate periodic monitoring and/or accountability procedures to ensure that its audits continue to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.

The audit SHALL be conducted by a Qualified Auditor, as specified in [Section 8.2](#82-identityqualifications-of-assessor).

For Delegated Third Parties that are not Enterprise RAs, then the CA SHALL obtain an audit report, issued under the auditing standards that underlie the accepted audit schemes found above in this [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), that provides an opinion whether the Delegated Third Party's performance complies with either the Delegated Third Party's practice statement or the CA's CP and/or CPS as described in [Section 1.3.2](#132-registration-authorities). If the opinion is that the Delegated Third Party does not comply, then the CA SHALL not allow the Delegated Third Party to continue performing delegated functions.

The audit period for the Delegated Third Party SHALL NOT exceed one year (ideally aligned with the CA's audit).
