##### 7.1.4.2.2 Subject Distinguished Name Fields

a. __Certificate Field:__ `subject:commonName` (OID 2.5.4.3)  
   __Required/Optional:__ __Deprecated__ (Discouraged, but not prohibited)  
   __Contents:__ If present, this field MUST contain exactly one entry that is one of the values contained in the Certificate's `subjectAltName` extension (see [Section 7.1.4.2.1](#71421-subject-alternative-name-extension)). The value of the field MUST be encoded as follows:

   * If the value is an IPv4 address, then the value MUST be encoded as an IPv4Address as specified in RFC 3986, Section 3.2.2.
   * If the value is an IPv6 address, then the value MUST be encoded in the text representation specified in RFC 5952, Section 4.
   * If the value is a Fully-Qualified Domain Name or Wildcard Domain Name, then the value MUST be encoded as a character-for-character copy of the `dNSName` entry value from the `subjectAltName` extension. Specifically, all Domain Labels of the Fully-Qualified Domain Name or FQDN portion of the Wildcard Domain Name must be encoded as LDH Labels, and P-Labels MUST NOT be converted to their Unicode representation.

b. __Certificate Field:__ `subject:organizationName` (OID 2.5.4.10)

The CA may include information in this field that differs slightly from the verified name, such as common variations or abbreviations, provided that the CA documents the difference and any abbreviations used are locally accepted abbreviations; e.g., if the official record shows "Company Name Incorporated", the CA MAY use "Company Name Inc." or "Company Name". Because Subject name attributes for individuals (e.g. givenName (2.5.4.42) and surname (2.5.4.4)) are not broadly supported by application software, the CA MAY use the `subject:organizationName` field to convey a natural person Subject's name or DBA.
