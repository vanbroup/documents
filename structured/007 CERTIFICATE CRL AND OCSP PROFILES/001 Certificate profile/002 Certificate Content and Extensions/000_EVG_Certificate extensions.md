### 7.1.2 Certificate extensions
The extensions listed in [Section 7.1.2](#712-certificate-extensions) are recommended for maximum interoperability between certificates and browsers / applications, but are not mandatory on the CAs except where indicated as “Required”.  CAs may use other extensions that are not listed in [Section 7.1.2](#712-certificate-extensions), but are encouraged to add them to this section by ballot from time to time to help increase extension standardization across the industry.

If a CA includes an extension in a certificate that has a Certificate field which is named in [Section 7.1.2](#712-certificate-extensions), the CA must follow the format specified in that subsection.  However, no extension or extension format shall be mandatory on a CA unless specifically stated as “Required” in the subsection that describes the extension.
