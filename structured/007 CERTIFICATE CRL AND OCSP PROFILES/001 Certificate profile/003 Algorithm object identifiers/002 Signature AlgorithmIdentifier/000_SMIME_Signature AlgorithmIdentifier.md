#### 7.1.3.2 Signature AlgorithmIdentifier

All objects signed by a CA Private Key SHALL conform to these requirements on the use of the `AlgorithmIdentifier` or `AlgorithmIdentifier`-derived type in the context of signatures.

In particular, it applies to all of the following objects and fields:

* The `signatureAlgorithm` field of a Certificate.
* The `signature` field of a TBSCertificate (for example, as used by a Certificate).
* The `signatureAlgorithm` field of a CertificateList
* The `signature` field of a TBSCertList
* The `signatureAlgorithm` field of a BasicOCSPResponse.

No other encodings are permitted for these fields.
