##### 7.1.3.2.1 RSA

The CA SHALL use one of the following signature algorithms and encodings. When encoded, the `AlgorithmIdentifier` MUST be byte-for-byte identical with the specified hex-encoded bytes.

* RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-256:

  Encoding:
  `300d06092a864886f70d01010b0500`.

* RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-384:

  Encoding:
  `300d06092a864886f70d01010c0500`.

* RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-512:

  Encoding:
  `300d06092a864886f70d01010d0500`.

* RSASSA-PSS with SHA-256, MGF-1 with SHA-256, and a salt length of 32 bytes:

  Encoding:

  ```hexdump
  304106092a864886f70d01010a3034a00f300d0609608648016503040201
  0500a11c301a06092a864886f70d010108300d0609608648016503040201
  0500a203020120
  ```

* RSASSA-PSS with SHA-384, MGF-1 with SHA-384, and a salt length of 48 bytes:

  Encoding:

  ```hexdump
  304106092a864886f70d01010a3034a00f300d0609608648016503040202
  0500a11c301a06092a864886f70d010108300d0609608648016503040202
  0500a203020130
  ```

* RSASSA-PSS with SHA-512, MGF-1 with SHA-512, and a salt length of 64 bytes:

  Encoding:

  ```hexdump
  304106092a864886f70d01010a3034a00f300d0609608648016503040203
  0500a11c301a06092a864886f70d010108300d0609608648016503040203
  0500a203020140
  ```

In addition, the CA MAY use the following signature algorithm and encoding if all of the following conditions are met:

* If used within a Certificate, such as the `signatureAlgorithm` field of a Certificate or the `signature` field of a TBSCertificate:
  * The new Certificate is a Root CA Certificate or Subordinate CA Certificate that is a Cross-Certificate; and,
  * There is an existing Certificate, issued by the same issuing CA Certificate, using the following encoding for the signature algorithm; and,
  * The existing Certificate has a `serialNumber` that is at least 64-bits long; and,
  * The only differences between the new Certificate and existing Certificate are one of the following:
    * A new `subjectPublicKey` within the `subjectPublicKeyInfo`, using the same algorithm and key size; and/or,
    * A new `serialNumber`, of the same encoded length as the existing Certificate; and/or
    * The new Certificate's `extKeyUsage` extension is present, has at least one key purpose specified, and none of the key purposes specified are the id-kp-serverAuth (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) or the anyExtendedKeyUsage (OID: 2.5.29.37.0) key purposes; and/or
    * The new Certificate's `basicConstraints` extension has a pathLenConstraint that is zero.
* If used within an OCSP response, such as the `signatureAlgorithm` of a BasicOCSPResponse:
  * The `producedAt` field value of the ResponseData MUST be earlier than 2022-06-01 00:00:00 UTC; and,
  * All unexpired, un-revoked Certificates that contain the Public Key of the CA Key Pair and that have the same Subject Name MUST also contain an `extKeyUsage` extension with the only key usage present being the id-kp-ocspSigning (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) key usage.
* If used within a CRL, such as the `signatureAlgorithm` field of a CertificateList or the `signature` field of a TBSCertList:
  * The CRL is referenced by one or more Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificates; and,
  * The Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificate has issued one or more Certificates using the following encoding for the signature algorithm.

**Note**: The above requirements do not permit a CA to sign a Precertificate with this encoding.

* RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-1:
